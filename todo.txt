The lackluster support for long double is disappointing. Consider the following workarounds:
- Add optional support for __float128
- Warn users if $N$ is too large and `long double` is not large enough
- Use C++23's stdfloat library...... I wish <stdfloat> existed forever ago



Misc:
- Check if n and p are actually numbers by making a function that checks every character in a string
- add an option to change the number of chars outputted. Maybe make pmf_string and cdf_string variables
that get changed if the user uses -b to possibly eliminate 2 if statements.
